# Project Plan: Multi-linguistic_Podcast_Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document lays out a project plan for the development of “Multi-linguistic_Podcast_Platform” open source repository system by USoC2020 Organization. 

The intended readers of this document are current and future developers working on “Multi-linguistic_Podcast_Platform” and the sponsors of the project. The plan will include, but is not restricted to, a summary of the system functionality, the scope of the project from the perspective of the “Multi-linguistic_Podcast_Platform” team, scheduling and delivery estimates, project risks and how those risks will be mitigated, the process by which I will develop the project, and metrics and measurements that will be recorded throughout the project.

## 2. Overview

Generally, the podcasts are available only in a single language, like the books used to be ideas worth spreading are, often, constrained by the language. Podcast by a non-native speaker is often skipped over, non-discriminatory, by both the native speakers and other non-native speakers. Our aim to develop a podcast application for the listeners who can listen the podcasts in their own 
native language. Our podcast platform is sure to outpace the existing ones because it features translating the existing podcasts into the user-preferred language.

## 5. Risk Management:

Our podcast platform is sure to outpace the existing ones because it features translating the existing podcasts into the user-preferred language.
Still, there lies a risk of keeping users engaged with our platform and attract their attention every time they need to listen to a podcast, while stuck in traffic on their way to work/home, or before plunging into their beds. While having a shower or while cooking in the kitchen.
This requires bringing proper recommendations to them, so the team needs to acknowledge this need.
Another risk can be the authenticity of the content. Therefore, our team has to work towards verifying the resources from where the content is being fetched.
